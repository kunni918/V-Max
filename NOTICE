Modifications

The following files have been modified from the original Waymax simulator and include custom changes:
 - vmax/simulator/waymax_overrides/visualization/viz.py:
    Modified viz for improved vizualisation.
 - vmax/simulator/waymax_overrides/visualization/utils.py:
    Modified utils, such as bounding box plotting, for improved vizualisation.
 - vmax/simulator/waymax_overrides/datatypes/roadgraph.py:
    Modified to include the rectangle filter to the roadgraph data, also modified filter_topk_roadgraph_points to keep the original ordering of the points in the roadgraph data (by lane instead of distance)
 - vmax/simulator/waymax_overrides/datatypes/observation.py:
    Modified to include proper transformation of the SDC paths data, and added a rectangle filter from the sdc_observation_from_state
